Times Like These (Ac√∫stico)
Dave Grohl

I, I'm a one way motorway
I'm a road that drives away
Then follows you back home
I, I'm a street light shining
I'm a white light blinding bright
Burning off and on

It's times like these
You learn to live again
It's times like these
You give and give again
It's times like these
You learn to love again
It's times like these
Time and time again

I, I'm a new day rising
I'm a brand new sky that
Hang the stars upon tonight
I, I'm a little divided
Do I stay or run away
And leave it all behind?

It's times like these
You learn to live again
It's times like these
You give and give again
It's times like these
You learn to love again
It's times like these
Time and time again

It's times like these
You learn to live again
It's times like these
You give and give again
It's times like these
You learn to love again
It's times like these
Time and time again

It's times like these
You learn to live again
It's times like these
You give and give again
It's times like these
You learn to love again
It's times like these
Time and time again

It's times like these
You learn to live again
It's times like these
You give and give again
It's times like these
You learn to love again
It's times like these
Time and time again
